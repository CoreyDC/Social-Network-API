## Description

My motivation for building this application was to build an social network database that contained users, the friends of those users, those users thoughts, and other users reactions to those thoughts. The application was built using mongo and the mongoose package. Other packages used were moment and express. Building this app taught me how to work with mongoDB and mongoose, including building models, routes and controllers for the database while using CRUD operations to get, add, update and delete data. 

## Installation

To install this application you will need to download virtual studio code or another code editor, setup your ssh keys, and copy the git repo into your local machine. You will also need to ensure you have node.js, and mongo.db downloaded on your machine as well.

## Usage

After you copy the repo into your machine, run npm run start and open insomnia in order to manipuate the database. Below is an example walkthrough video:
